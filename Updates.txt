19.11.2022 - Added an opening and closing function for the servo mechanism. Have yet to add S1 funcionality in the future.
Author: Maciej Zieliński, Bartosz Żołądź

22.11.2022 - Added S1 funcionality and fixed a bug which caused servo to constantly spin in one direction.
There are still issues left with opening and closing the barrier, have yet to fix that.
Author: Maciej Zieliński

24.11.2022 - After consulting with our project supervisor, we decided to focus on adding a timer to measure the time of opening and closing functions
in order to hopefully fix the inconsistent servo mechanism handling.
